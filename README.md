transparency towards our customers and that the things meant for developers should be evaluated
and supported by developers.

## Features üó≥Ô∏è

As being a software-as-a-service to enhance the developer experience by leveraging edge computing
to deliver feature flags accurately and fast, Planria provides features such as:

- **SDK to manage, modify, and read your feature flags on the fly.**
- **Projects**
  - Add, edit, or delete projects.
  - Invite other users to projects. We don't create organisations and high difficulty permissions, 
  we create projects that can be shared to those who manage and develop them. No fuss, no difficulty.
- **Environments**
  - Add, edit, or remove environments. 
  - By default, we create **Development** and **Production** automatically for you when 
  you create a new project. ([See Spec](./docs/roadmap/2024/Q4/Auto-Create%20Environments.md)).
  - Bulk action to create multiple environments, _e.g._, for SaaS with the need to manage flags for
  multiple countries. ([See Spec](./docs/roadmap/2025/Q1/Bulk%20Action%20for%20Multi%20Country%20Projects.md))
- **Access tokens**
  - Generate and delete access tokens per environment.
  - Auto-create the access tokens for the bulk-action of environments. ([See Spec](./docs/roadmap/2025/Q1/Bulk%20Action%20for%20Multi%20Country%20Projects.md))
- **Feature Flags**
  - Add, edit, or delete feature flags.
  - When a feature flag is created, the user provides a default value that is forwarded to the environments
  if there are no custom values set to a specific environment.
  - Toggle feature flag per environment.
  - **Scheduled Flagging:** Help you not stay up all night to deploy something to production by 
  giving you the option to schedule when your feature flag should be enabled or disabled. ([See Spec](./docs/roadmap/2025/Q1/Scheduled%20Flagging.md))

## Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è

Our roadmap is always evolving and prioritising what we'll develop in the next weeks and so. 
As we don't use tools such as Jira or Linear and we don't follow any Agile methodologies, 
our roadmap is highly and frequently editable.

We separate our roadmap into quarters and years.

- **2024**
  - **Q4**
    - [Auto-Create Environments](./docs/roadmap/2024/Q4/Auto-Create%20Environments.md)
- **2025**
  - **Q1**
    - [Bulk Action for Multi Country Projects](./docs/roadmap/2025/Q1/Bulk%20Action%20for%20Multi%20Country%20Projects.md)
    - [Scheduled Flagging](./docs/roadmap/2025/Q1/Scheduled%20Flagging.md)
