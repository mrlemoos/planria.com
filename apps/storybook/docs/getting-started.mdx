We use Git for version control. Make sure you have Git installed and are familiar with its basics.

### Development Tools

Your development environment is critical. Here are some tools and resources to help you set up your workspace:

- **Package Manager**: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the package manager we use for JavaScript projects. Install it to manage project dependencies.

- **Turborepo**: [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/) is a monorepo tool that helps manage multiple packages in a single repository. It's a key tool for our development workflow.

- **Storybook**: [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to view and interact with components in isolation, making development and testing easier.
