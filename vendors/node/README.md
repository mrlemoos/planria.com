# planria-sdk/node

`@planria-sdk/node` is also the base module that handles the CLI (command-line interface)
for the primordial commands necessary for Planria to deploy your feature flags like a charm
and make your competition doubt their own minds just like me when I think about my lady 
friend at night and cry myself to sleep.
