# Bulk Action for Multi Country Projects

**Spec:** Bulk action to create multiple environments, _e.g._, for SaaS with the need 
to manage flags for multiple countries.

This should also bulk-generate the access tokens and somehow provide it to the user
during the onboarding.

> NOTE:
> Do it during the onboarding so the user only is prompted once.
